    <h3>About</h3>
    <p><i>Ask Toscanini! </i>  expedites the music score finding process by supporting search queries which pertain 
    to the content and structure of music. Using standard music terminology, 
    musicians can find repertoire relevant to their ensemble's playing
    needs beyond what is possible with existing commercial 
    engines which tend to operate solely on metadata (title, composer name, genre, etc.). 
      
      We have written a paper detailing the anatomy of the engine
      <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~tilevich/papers/toscanini.pdf">here</a>.
      <br /><br />
      Developer: Arman Bahraini (arman1 at vt.edu)
      <br />
      Supervisor: Dr. Eli Tilevich (tilevich at cs.vt.edu)
    </p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Suppose you want pieces with flute that plays in range D4 G#6 and viola in C3 E5...</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Enter an instrument range query in the search box below as "flute D4 G#6 and viola C3 E5"
      (without quotes)</li>
      <li>Hit the "Toscanini Search" button and
            we'll show you our matching scores as PDF or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicXML" target="_blank"> MusicXML </a>
        !
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Supported Queries</h5> 
    <ul>
      <li>See all scores we have by leaving the search box empty</li>
      <li>Query for an instrument with a specific range, ex: trumpet F#3 D5</li>
      <li>Query for composer or instrument (no range), ex: "bach", "viola", etc.</li>
      <li>Query for tempo between range, ex: "tempo 40 130"</li>
      <li>Query for key signature, ex: "key Bb"</li>
      <li>Query for time signature, ex: "ts 2 4"</li>
      <li>Query for dynamic (anywhere in the score), ex: "dynamic mf". Currently the supported 
        representations for dynamics are: 
        f, ff, fff, ffff, fffff, ffffff, fp, fz, mf, mp, p, pp, ppp,
        pppp, ppppp, pppppp, rf, rfz, sf, sffz, sfp, sfpp, sfz</li>
      <li>Putting it all together: "Beethoven and tempo 75 150 and 
      flute D4 G#6  and trumpet F#3 A5 and key Bb and ts 2 4 and dynamic mp
      and dynamic ff"</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Side Notes</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>This engine is not case sensitive</li>
      <li>Queries are checked for name inclusion, 
      so querying for "trumpet F3 D5" can give you scores with 
      "Trumpets in C" assuming the range is appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>
      Our engine supports syntactic and semantic error checking. What this means is that we try to detect typos
      or otherwise musically invalid search conditions, so you won't be presented with irrelevant scores. The language 
      of music is of course very intricate and filled with edge cases however. If you feel a search query isn't returning 
      scores correctly, or if you have any other suggestions, please feel free to contact the developer.
